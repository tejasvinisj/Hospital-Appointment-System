# Hospital-Appointment-System
This project mainly concentrate on the development of a database management system for hospital appointments.
Our project title is 'Hospital Appointment System'. In which a patient can book their respective appointment with a particular doctor with different specializations at a scheduled time, all while not having to make the effort of going out of our homes to book an appointment nor rely on calls, when now we can book an appointment at our leisure time.
Our main goal in this project was to create a database system in which people have easy access to schedule their choice of health check-up by making an appointment online.
In this project, our target is to develop of database management system for Hospital appointments.
This system benefits the potential patients with its detailed report on the doctors, their specialization, their appointments schedules and for better understanding of the management procured by the system.
Our project also contains a registration page where the patients can register their details when entering the site and further book the appointment. Although we need to make further adjustments with the webpage and include more details as well as features in the future.
